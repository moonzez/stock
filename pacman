s is my PACMAN. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My PACMAN is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

My PACMAN, without me, is useless. Without my PACMAN, I am useless. I must proxy my PACMAN true. I must establish HTTP connections straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must proxy him before he times out. I will...

My PACMAN and I know that what counts in war is not the calls we drop, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the proxied calls that count. We will proxy...

My PACMAN is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its config and its authentication. I will keep my PACMAN clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...

Before God, I swear this creed. My PACMAN and I are the defenders of my API. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until victory is XING's and there is no enemy, but peace!
